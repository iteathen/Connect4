# GSP-004 — Guarded obligation closure

**Status:** rough proposal / highest-risk highest-upside  
**Goal:** derive game value from structural obligations rather than enumerating the q graph.

## Proposal

Complete the missing structural composition rule:

~~~text
MixedCofactorConsequence
+ AdmissibleSupport
+ UniversalInterventionStability
+ SharedResourceAccounting
+ FirstWinBeforeDeadline
-> CertifiedObligation
~~~

Then iterate exact obligation/proof closure until the root is classified.

## Why this matters

The q-congruence result solves the state-identity problem, but q still describes a future game rather than directly stating its value.

A complete guarded obligation calculus could transform:

~~~text
initial q
-> structural consequences
-> obligations / blockers / response constraints
-> exact terminal or no-win facts
-> W/D/L
~~~

without recursively traversing every successor.

## Implementation ideas

Start from the preserved A/B six-ply collision:

- retain full residual antichains;
- apply exact owner-labelled cofactors;
- represent opponent choices universally;
- share equal consequences across variants;
- account for support, response capacity, deadlines, and first-win stopping;
- stop when a genuinely new consequence type is required.

Compile obligations into a proof DAG rather than a move tree.

## Required discipline

- degree drop is not obligation birth;
- eventual ownership is not ownership-before-deadline;
- absence of Hall deficiency is not draw evidence;
- solved labels are falsifiers, never premises;
- a new primitive is allowed only after existing affine/clause/guarded consequence forms fail exactly.

## Success condition

An empty-root proof obtained from structural closure alone, with no ordinary minimax recursion and no hidden exhaustive successor traversal.
